## ⭐ Overview

CodeLens is an AI-powered debugging assistant built with **Gemini 3 Pro**.  
It helps beginners understand *why* their code breaks instead of just showing a fix.

Whether you paste code, upload a screenshot, or point your phone camera at your screen, CodeLens explains the error visually through **ASCII execution-flow diagrams**, corrected code, and guided practice questions.

Supported languages include **Python, R, JavaScript, Java, and C++**.
